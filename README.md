!# NewSO

A full reimplementation of The Sims Online, using Monogame. While FreeSO aims to be faithful to the original game, it includes many quality of life changes such as hardware rendering, custom dynamic lighting, hi-res output and >2 floor houses. If you simply wish to play, you can install FreeSO and the original TSO files using our installer on http://freeso.org, and it will connect to our official servers.

FreeSO currently depends on the original game files (objects, avatars, ui) to function, which are available for download from EA servers. FreeSO is simply a game engine, and does not contain any copyrighted material in and of itself.

# Volcanic

Volcanic is an extension of FreeSO that allows users to view, modify and save game objects alongside a live instance of the SimAntics VM. It features a vast array of resource editors for objects - the most prominent being the script editor. It allows for easy creation of new objects, and debugging of existing ones. Volcanic also functions when the FSO engine has loaded TS1 objects and other resources.
